## Usage

Here is `meta.yaml`

```yaml
name: Build

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-artifacts: 
  - import-yaml: node/setup.yaml

  - import-yaml: git/configure.yaml

  - name: Install and Build üöÄ
    run: |
      yarn
```

Here is `node/setup.yaml`

```yaml
name: Setup Node.js üåê
uses: actions/setup-node@v4
with:
  node-version: ${{yamlize.NODE_VERSION}}
  cache: 'yarn'
```

Here is `git/configure.yaml`

```yaml
name: Configure Git üõ†
run: |
  git config user.name "${{yamlize.git.USER_NAME}}"
  git config user.email "${{yamlize.git.USER_EMAIL}}"
```

Now call `yamlize`, and provide a context

```js
    yamlize(metaYaml, outFile, {
        git: {
            USER_NAME: 'Cosmology',
            USER_EMAIL: 'developers@cosmology.zone',
        },
        EMSCRIPTEN_VERSION: '3.1.59',
        NODE_VERSION: '20.x' 
    });
```

Output:

```yaml
name: Build
on:
  workflow_dispatch: null
jobs:
  build-artifacts:
    - name: Setup Node.js üåê
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 20.x
        cache: yarn
    - name: Configure Git üõ†
      run: |
        git config user.name "Cosmology"
        git config user.email "developers@cosmology.zone"
    - name: Install and Build üöÄ
      run: |
        yarn
```
