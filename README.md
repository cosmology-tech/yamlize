`yamlize` is a powerful tool designed to simplify the creation of YAML files by allowing dynamic generation based on predefined templates and contextual data. This tool is especially useful in environments where configurations need to be adjusted frequently, such as in CI/CD workflows. It provides flexibility in integrating changes seamlessly and ensures configurations are up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.

## install

```sh
npm install yamlize
```

For CI/CD and easier usage, use [our CLI](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/yamlize/tree/main/packages/cli):

```sh
npm install @yamlize/cli
```

or for your own use:

```sh
npm install -g @yamlize/cli
```

## Usage

`yamlize` helps you dynamically generate YAML configurations using predefined templates and context. Here‚Äôs how to use it with example YAML templates and the corresponding JavaScript function call:

### Example 

**meta.yaml** - This is your main workflow template.

```yaml
name: Build

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build-artifacts: 
  - import-yaml: node/setup.yaml
  - import-yaml: git/configure.yaml
  - name: Install and Build üöÄ
    run: |
      yarn
```

**node/setup.yaml** - Sets up your Node.js environment.

```yaml
name: Setup Node.js üåê
uses: actions/setup-node@v4
with:
  node-version: ${{yamlize.NODE_VERSION}}
  cache: 'yarn'
```

**git/configure.yaml** - Configures Git with user information.

```yaml
name: Configure Git üõ†
run: |
  git config user.name "${{yamlize.git.USER_NAME}}"
  git config user.email "${{yamlize.git.USER_EMAIL}}"
```

### Invoking Yamlize

Provide the `meta.yaml` template and your specific context to generate the complete YAML configuration.

```js
yamlize(metaYaml, outFile, {
    git: {
        USER_NAME: 'Cosmology',
        USER_EMAIL: 'developers@cosmology.zone',
    },
    EMSCRIPTEN_VERSION: '3.1.59',
    NODE_VERSION: '20.x' 
});
```

### Output Example

Here's the generated YAML configuration reflecting the provided context.

```yaml
name: Build
on:
  workflow_dispatch: null
jobs:
  build-artifacts:
    - name: Setup Node.js üåê
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: 20.x
        cache: yarn
    - name: Configure Git üõ†
      run: |
        git config user.name "Cosmology"
        git config user.email "developers@cosmology.zone"
    - name: Install and Build üöÄ
      run: |
        yarn
```
